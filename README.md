## Motivation

I am a bootcamp student and will need to practice my JavaScript knowledge. 

## Problem Solved

This quiz enables me to test my knowledge. It can be added to as I learn more topics to make it more comprehensive.

## What I Learned
In this project I learnt how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript, dynamically generating content. 

The length of code for this project was significantly greater than previous ones and it was necessary to write comments as I went along for ease of reading.

## Site Access
This site was built using Github Pages and can be found [here](https://craigrobertsdev.github.io/javascript-quiz/)
